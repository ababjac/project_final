Basic Outline of Project Steps (Entire Project):
1. Go through PyGame tutorials
2. Get familiar with PyGame by creating test program
3. Outline basic app structure in PyGame
4. Check in with Zoe on development of game logic
5. Begin to combine game logic with app interface
6. Error check and test app
7. Revise app for better functionality
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7
