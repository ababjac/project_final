Basic Outline of Project Steps (Entire Project):
1. Go through PyGame tutorials
2. Get familiar with PyGame by creating test program
3. Outline basic app structure in PyGame
4. Check in with Zoe on development of game logic
5. Begin to combine game logic with app interface
6. Error check and test app
7. Revise app for better functionality
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7


Sprint Plans:
sprint 1 -- Steps 1-3 above
sprint 2 -- step 4-5 above
sprint 3 -- step 6-7 above
sprint 4 -- step 8 above


Project Rubric Breakdown (Sprint 1):
10 points - prototype (step 3 above) code compiles (drum_machine_v_0.0.py)
10 points - prototype (step 3 above) code uses PyGame library successfully
5 points - proof of step 1 and 2 (above) in git repo as init.py
15 points - proof of step 3 above in git repo as drum_machine_v_0.0 that outlines the basic app structure
Total: 40 points


Time Sheet (until 3/29/19):
3/20/19 -- 2 hrs -- Went through PyGame tutorials
3/21/19 -- 2 hrs -- Created a game to test out PyGame functionality (init.py)
3/25/19 -- 2 hrs -- Worked on milestones.txt and Rubric
3/27/19-3/28/19 -- 2 hrs -- Worked on basic app design and researched menus/drop down menu


Summary of Sprint 1:
I began outlining the basic app structure (i.e. where buttons should go). It looks really crummy right now,
but I am researching libraries that would allow for a "prettier" user interface. I am doing research into
the PyGameMenu library for a nicer app interface. I am having trouble getting the PyGameMenu code to compile
for my project, but I will keep error checking over the weekend. I also ran into trouble with the sound .wav files
throwing seg faults. They open on Zoe's computer with the same exact lines of code, so it might be an error with the
cloning process. Overall, no major set backs (just a couple minor ones) and the app design is on schedule to be
completed by mid-end next week, so that Zoe and I can start combining the app design with the app logic.


Next Steps Rubric/Plan (Sprint 2):
1. Meet with Zoe and discuss progress
2. Begin combining together app and game logic
3. Begin testing
